# Feel Good - Implementation Details

## Overview
Feel Good is a universal game for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS built with Swift and SwiftUI. The game displays randomly positioned rectangles that the player must tap to score points. Occasionally, tapping a rectangle reveals a beautiful flower image.

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- **SwiftUI**: Used for the UI layer to ensure compatibility across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS
- **MVVM Pattern**: Separation of game state (model), views, and view models
- **Singleton Managers**: Used for CloudKit, GameCenter, and Sound management

### Core Game Features
1. **Rectangle Generation**:
   - Rectangles appear in random positions every 2 seconds by default
   - Size is 30-40% of screen width/height
   - Position ensures rectangles are fully within screen bounds
   - Various colors and gradients (solid, linear, radial)

2. **Animations**:
   - Smooth fade-in/scale-up when rectangles appear
   - Pleasing fade-out/scale-up when tapped
   - Rotating flower animation when special flower appears

3. **Sound Effects**:
   - Pleasant sound on successful tap
   - Special sound when flower appears
   - Implemented through AVFoundation

4. **Game State Management**:
   - Tracks score and flowers seen
   - Configurable rectangle appearance interval (0.1s to 5s)
   - Pause functionality that saves state

### Cloud Integration
1. **iCloud Sync**:
   - Uses CloudKit for cross-device synchronization
   - Syncs game state (score, flowers seen, settings)
   - Handles conflict resolution by taking highest scores

2. **GameCenter Integration**:
   - Player authentication
   - Leaderboard for scores
   - Achievements at 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000, 100000, and 500000 taps

## File Structure
- **FeelGood.swift**: Main app entry point
- **ContentView.swift**: Root view container
- **GameView.swift**: Main game screen
- **SettingsView.swift**: Settings configuration screen
- **GameState.swift**: Game state management
- **RectangleGenerator.swift**: Logic for generating random rectangles
- **RectangleView.swift**: Visual representation of game rectangles
- **FlowerView.swift**: Flower animation view
- **CloudKitManager.swift**: iCloud synchronization
- **GameCenterManager.swift**: GameCenter integration
- **SoundManager.swift**: Sound effect management

## Testing
The game has been designed with testability in mind:
- Game state is separated from UI logic
- Managers use dependency injection where appropriate
- Core game logic can be unit tested independently

## Future Improvements
1. Add more visual variety to rectangles (patterns, textures)
2. Implement difficulty levels that affect rectangle size and timing
3. Add haptic feedback for successful taps
4. Create more achievement types (e.g., for flowers seen)
5. Add accessibility features for wider audience
